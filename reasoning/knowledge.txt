[On-top Site: The adsorbate binds directly to a single surface atom.,
Bridge Site: The adsorbate simultaneously binds to two adjacent surface atoms.,
Hollow Site: The adsorbate interacts with three or more surface atoms, typically forming a triangular arrangement.,
End-on Orientation: The adsorbate molecule attaches to the surface through one of its terminal atoms.,
Side-on Orientation: The adsorbate interacts with the surface via multiple atoms along its side.,
Site Matching: The adsorption site should correspond to the number of surface atoms available for binding.,
Orientation Alignment: The binding atoms in the adsorbate should match its orientation on the surface.,
The side-on orientation requires multiple binding atoms.,
The end-on orientation requires just one binding atom.]
